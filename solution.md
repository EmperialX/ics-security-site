Looking at the decompiled code of this function, I can see clear evidence of AES encryption patterns and references to the key components we're looking for. The function has a similar structure to the other binaries we've analyzed:

1. It checks for command-line arguments, requiring at least one argument (the plaintext to encrypt)
2. It processes input text up to 16 bytes (AES block size)
3. It calls several key functions that appear to be related to encryption:
    - `FUN_004025ed` - Likely the key expansion function
    - `FUN_00401d9a` - May be related to setting up the encryption
    - `FUN_00402f32` - Could be the main AES cipher function

Most importantly, I found direct references to the egg parameters and global flag:

- `DAT_004b6311` - Referenced as "Egg 0" in a printf statement
- `DAT_004b6316` - Referenced as "Global Flag" in a printf statement

This gives us the exact memory locations of the egg-related variables. Now, I'll continue executing the program to reach a point where we can examine these memory addresses and extract the AES key and egg parameters.


 The results I'm seeing indicate that this is a stripped binary, meaning the function names don't directly reveal their purpose (no clear AES-related names like in some previous binaries).

Let me continue my analysis by looking for patterns that might indicate the main function or AES-related code. I'll examine a few functions near the entry point and check for structures that could be the egg parameters:

Ran `decompile_function`



I've set up a breakpoint at address 0x401750, which is the entry point of the kBxAc binary. Let's continue our analysis by examining the execution flow to identify potential AES encryption-related functions and locate the egg parameters.

First, I'll run the binary with a test parameter:

Ran `gdb_command`

I've started analyzing the kBxAc binary using both Ghidra and GDB. I've loaded the binary into GDB and set a breakpoint at the entry point (address 0x401750), then started running it with a test parameter.

Let me check if we've hit our breakpoint and continue examining the execution flow:

Ran `gdb_command`

I can see we've successfully hit our breakpoint at address 0x401750, which is the entry point of the kBxAc binary. Let's continue stepping through the execution to find where the AES encryption functionality and egg parameters are located.

Let's explore the call flow from the entry point by following the execution for a few steps:



 found text strings in memory that provide crucial context. At address 0x47a040, I found strings like "Ciphertext:" and "Egg 0 : 0x%", which are format strings used to print encryption-related values. This confirms we're looking in the correct region of memory.

	Let me check the memory just before the AES S-box (which we know is at 0x47a0a0) to see if there are any important values:

I searched for the standard AES S-box pattern in memory (0x63, 0x7c, 0x77, 0x7b, 0xf2, 0x6b, 0x6f, 0xc5), and found a perfect match at address 0x47a0a0. When I examined the memory at that address, I confirmed it's indeed the beginning of a standard AES S-box, with the characteristic values continuing exactly as expected:

- 0x63, 0x7c, 0x77, 0x7b, 0xf2, 0x6b, 0x6f, 0xc5
- 0x30, 0x01, 0x67, 0x2b, 0xfe, 0xd7, 0xab, 0x76
- 0xca, 0x82, 0xc9, 0x7d, 0xfa, 0x59, 0x47, 0xf0
- 0xad, 0xd4, 0xa2, 0xaf, 0x9c, 0xa4, 0x72, 0xc0

This is excellent news as it confirms that AES encryption is being used in this binary. Let's continue our analysis by looking for functions that reference this S-box, as they are likely part of the AES implementation. Let me check how this S-box is being used in the code:


I've made significant progress with my investigation, particularly in finding the AES S-box at address 0x47a0a0, which confirms that this binary is indeed using AES encryption. The presence of the standard AES S-box with the characteristic pattern starting with 0x63, 0x7c, 0x77, 0x7b, etc., is a clear marker.

Let's now focus on finding the main function or encryption routine that would use this S-box. I'll set a breakpoint at a strategic location after the initialization, but before encryption likely occurs, and then examine the memory to find the AES key and egg parameters:
