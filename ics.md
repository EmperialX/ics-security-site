  - Process network with PLCs (Level 1)
  - Field network with sensors and actuators (Level 0)
- **Protocol Implementation**: Modbus TCP, DNP3, OPC UA
- **Network Segmentation**: Firewall-controlled boundaries between zones

## Slide 4: LOLBin Techniques in ICS
- **Definition**: Legitimate executables misused for malicious purposes
- **Unique Challenge in ICS**: Difficult to distinguish between legitimate and malicious use
- **Classification Framework**:
  - Engineering workstation tools (PLC programming software)
  - Diagnostic utilities (protocol analyzers)
  - Remote management tools
  - Data transfer tools
  - Configuration utilities
- **Implemented Toolset**: Demonstrated how 15+ legitimate ICS tools can be weaponized

## Slide 5: ICS Kill Chain Implementation
- **Two-Stage Attack Model**:
  1. **Stage 1**: Traditional IT intrusion (reconnaissance, initial access, lateral movement)
  2. **Stage 2**: ICS-specific attacks (development, validation, and execution)
- **Comprehensive Mapping**: All attack activities mapped to ICS Kill Chain phases
- **Key Achievement**: Demonstrated complete attack kill chain from enterprise network to physical impact
- **Unique Contribution**: Integration of LOLBin techniques with established kill chain methodology

## Slide 6: Attack Simulation Scenarios
- **Initial Access via Corporate Network**: Enterprise web application vulnerability exploitation
- **Protocol-Based Attacks**: Modbus function code scanning, register manipulation
- **Engineering Workstation Compromise**: Legitimate PLC programming tools misuse
- **Firmware-Based Attack**: Modification through legitimate update utilities

- **Key Results**: 92% success rate for process manipulation with only 27% detection rate

## Slide 7: Technical Implementation
- **Docker Containerization**: Isolated network zones with appropriate segmentation
- **Protocol Implementation**: Python-based implementations of industrial protocols
  - Modbus TCP server/client using PyModbus
  - OPC UA using opcua library
  - DNP3 using pydnp3
- **Process Simulation**: Realistic power grid infrastructure with PLCs, HMIs, historians
- **Security Controls**: Implementation of IEC 62443 security controls with effectiveness measurement
- **Data Collection**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of attack activities

## Slide 8: Defense Analysis
- **Deployed Security Controls**:
  - Network segmentation (Purdue Model implementation)
  - Access control (role-based)
  - Protocol filtering (deep packet inspection)
  - Behavioral monitoring
  - Integrity monitoring
- **Control Effectiveness**: Behavioral monitoring most effective (81%) but highest false positives (24%)
- **Defense-in-Depth**: Even with multiple controls, maximum achieved protection was 85%
- **Key Finding**: Traditional controls ineffective against LOLBin techniques that use legitimate tools with legitimate credentials

## Slide 9: IEC 62443 Compliance Analysis
- **Security Level Assessment**: Environment achieved SL2 with partial SL3 implementation
- **Control System Security Requirements**: 
  - Evaluated effectiveness against established standards
  - Identified critical gaps in standard recommendations
- **Standard Enhancement Recommendations**:
  - Behavioral profiling requirements
  - Context-aware authentication
  - Process value verification
  - Tool usage auditing
  - Protocol command validation

## Slide 10: Key Findings & Contributions
- **High Success Rate**: LOLBin-based attacks achieved 92% success with only 37% detection
- **Defense Bypass**: Traditional security controls largely ineffective
- **Protocol Vulnerabilities**: Industrial protocols remain highly exploitable
- **Theoretical Framework**: Created comprehensive classification of ICS LOLBins
- **Remediation Strategies**: Developed novel defensive approaches
